An 8x8 board game where each of the two players controls 8 pieces. One piece can only be moved diagonally by one square. A piece can be captured if it can't be validly moved anywhere. The winner of the game is the one who manages to capture all the enemy pieces. The game can be played both locally between 2 players or against quite a challenging computer. There's also a replay system which can be used for watching a previously played match.
